### All our aggregates are wrong

>Business requirements are seldom as simple as they seem. What happens when the requirements start to get more complex than your original design? Will you be able to adapt?

#### When things get complex

When requirements start to get more complex, you may find yourself in a predicament. Do you introduce technical shortcuts (full of code smells) for the sake of delivering on schedule? Or do you rewrite from scratch?

In this webinar, we'll analyze what appears to be a straightforward e-commerce shopping cart. Then we'll add a few more use cases that make it more complex, and see how it can negatively impact the quality of the overall design. Finally, we'll focus our attention on the business needs behind these requriements, and see how it can shed light on the correct approach to designing these features.

In the end, we'll have a new understanding of how to take requirements apart to build the right software.

#### In this webinar you'll learn about:

* Basics of vertical slice service architecture
* Strategies for decomposing services into slices
* How services can communicate effectively
* Techniques for combining data from multiple services into a single ViewModel
