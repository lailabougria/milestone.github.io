I’m so excited to announce that starting today I’ll be a Solution Architect in [Particular Software](http://particular.net/), an amazing group of awesome people, supporting customers in their journey with [NServiceBus](http://particular.net/nservicebus) and the [Particular Platform](http://particular.net/service-platform).

I have no words to express my satisfaction, so enjoy:

This long journey started 15 years ago and is really far away from its end, but this is one of those milestones that can change your life, at least changed mine.

There is a long list of people I must (yes must) thank, too easy to miss someone, but at least 3 were a game changer in my life, so thank you [Raffaele](http://www.iamraf.net/), [Lorenzo](http://www.geniodelmale.info/) and [Andrea](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/pape/). (in strict order of appearance).
