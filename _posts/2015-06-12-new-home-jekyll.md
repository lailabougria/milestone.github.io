I decided to move this blog from Blogger, where it was hosted, to GitHub pages, the main reason that drove this decision is the [European cookie law](http://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/) and the absurd way it is applied in Italy, basically forcing me to pay taxes for a thing I am not using but that I cannot disable.

The interesting thing of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is that they support [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a ruby powered, blog aware, content generation engine that can generate static sites. And if you think about it a blog is a static thing. 

The blog template I'm actually using is the default one, I don't like it, I have a plan to create my own template, a long term plan :-)
