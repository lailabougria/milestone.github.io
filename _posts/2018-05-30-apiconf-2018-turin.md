Once again I'll have the pleasure of presenting at a conference organized by [Cloud Conf folks](https://twitter.com/_CloudConf_).

This time the topic is one of my favorite: Services UI Composition!

The talk will cover how to build a UI for a system built using a microservices architecture. The talk will be in Italian and details are available on the [event page](/events/api-conf-2018.html).

If you happen to be in Turin, that by the way is a wonderful city, take a chance to attend this [very well organized conference](https://2018.apiconf.it/). And come and say hi!
