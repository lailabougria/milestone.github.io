In the last two installments, "Lifehacking 101: I'm bad at to-do lists, now what?" and "Lifehacking 101: without data we're blind", I described some of the problems and some of the corrections I implemented over the years to alleviate or fix these problems.

This post focuses on journaling and the way I'm using it. In my case, journaling is not coming as a solution to any problem; I'm using it as a discovery technique. I'm looking for opportunities and patterns rather than problems.

Everything started a few years ago. I was handling my day-to-day work using a technique similar to the Pomodoro technique. I used a small physical planner; I was listing things to do every day and checking them off once completed. Finally, at the end of each day, I was:

- Copying incomplete items to the next day
- Writing a short retrospective at the end of today's page

It was one of my first attempts at managing my day. Was it effective? In the beginning, yes, in the long term, no. The [procrastinator](https://milestone.topics.it/2019/01/23/i-m-a-procrastinator-i-fail-at-to-do-lists.html) in me took over. However, the experience paved the way for what I'm doing today.

Now that I'm reasonably confident that the techniques I'm using work for me and are effective, it's time to discuss how to look for improvements. I'm continuing my data collection through the calendar and a spreadsheet, and I'll review the situation more or less every six months.

A few weeks ago I read ["How to be lucky"](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-open-up-to-serendipity-and-create-your-own-luck) from [Psyche](https://psyche.com) (I suggest subscribing), and the thing that caught my attention was the suggestion of getting in the habit of journaling:

> If you are new to journaling, don't overthink it. Set a timer for two minutes, then list out in two columns the parts of your day that led to positive outcomes and the parts of the day that did not. As you break down your day into these segments, examine the parts that worked really well for you, and the ones that were inefficient, stressful or unfulfilling. You might begin to notice some patterns that stand out, for good or bad. Journalling and reflection is a way to begin decluttering your life, to explore the areas that take you out of being present, and keep you from recognizing serendipity. Sometimes, it's the seemingly small and insignificant nuisances that can deplete your energy and alertness the most.

(emphasis is mine)

I started doing it 20 days ago. It's straightforward; it takes 2 minutes. I'm not listing all the things that I did. As suggested, I'm merely listing things that led to a positive or negative outcome. I'm skipping everything that went as expected. For example, if I planned to sit down and write some code, and I happened to do it, I don't list that in the journal. Instead, if I joined a one on one that led to an unexpected outcome, either positive or negative, I try to analyze the motivations and note them down in that day's journal.

It surprised me that writing down things makes them vividly stick in my head: I don't need to go back and read what I journaled two days ago. While I'm writing, I can see emerging patterns; it's clear that certain behaviors, actions, or environments lead to positive or negative outcomes. Those are opportunities to improve.

## Conclusion

There are two things that I don't like. Getting at my desk every morning and being faced with the question, "what am I going to do today?," is one. It is an open door for context switching and unproductivity. It can only destroy my day. The second is that I'm bad at is brainstorming alone. If I need to sit down and think about questions like "what can I improve?" or "what's going wrong?" it'll get me nowhere. Carefully planning my week proved to be extremely effective in answering the first question. Journaling appears to be influential in shaping what's next.
