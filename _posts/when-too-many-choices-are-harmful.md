synopsis: "I tend to be lazy and pragmatic when it comes to choices. It's also trivial that being exposed to too many options stresses me producing a negative result. I end up refusing to choose."

I prefer restaurants with short menus rather than encyclopedic ones. When sitting at a table, faced with pages of choices and the pressure the waiter puts on me, I urge to wake up and escape.

I recently had a similar experience while [looking for a new smartwatch](https://milestone.topics.it/2021/12/27/do-I-still-need-a-smartwatch.html) to track my fitness activities. I'm a Garmin user. If I'll ever buy a new device, there is no point in paying the price of switching to something else. The cost of transferring years of data is too high.

Recently Garmin released the Fenix 7. I hear my colleague [Christian](https://twitter.com/cquirosj) whispering, "have a look, Mauro. Have a look..." ðŸ˜†

But, there is also the new Epix gen 2, the Forerunner 945, 745, 245, or the Swim 2, to name a few. Their menu is so long!
Garmin offers so many smartwatches that the least guarantee is a headache. And that, only by looking at the plethora of products. If you look at all the different versions each product offers, your head can only explode. All that becomes particularly true if you start comparing them. Most of them (if not the majority) provide the same set of functionalities, and one starts arguing why. For example, take a look at [this comparison](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/catalog/product/compareResult.ep?compareProduct=735611&compareProduct=760778&compareProduct=621922&compareProduct=713363) between four models. It's hard to spot the differences. 

Another important factor contributing to the Garmin headache is the price range. Hundreds of models with slight to no differences with incredible differences in prices. That makes it even harder to choose.

## What has all this in common with software architecture?

At first sight, nothing. And maybe it's just me removing a pebble from my shoe. Yet, there are two critical learnings. Do your best to avoid having many ways to achieve the same result. And, when presenting options, provide crisp differences.

### Many ways lead to undesirable questions 

For example, there are [many different ways](https://nodogmablog.bryanhogan.net/2022/01/a-few-ways-of-setting-the-kestrel-ports-in-net-6/) to set the Kestrel web server port. While reading the article, I started asking myself, why is that? And I had the same feelings a long restaurant menu creates. Not to mention that, as Bryan Hogan said in the article, you'll start asking questions like:

- Is option A better than option B, and why is that?
- How do I override that setting if set with option A, and will it work the same using option B?
- How do I get the current value? Oh, does it depend on how I set it?

#### The more the options, the more the questions

Even if we spend hours documenting all the possibilities in a vain attempt to cover all scenarios, there are [well-known reasons](https://medium.com/helppier/read-product-documentation-40eeab82f04a) why users don't read manuals and instructions. It means that no matter the effort we put in the documentation, questions and confusion are just around the corner.

### Slight differences lead to confusion

The second but equally important aspect is how different the available options are. Crispness is crucial to guide users towards the pit of success. Let's imagine the menu offers a few pizzas, and the only difference is the presence of oregano for two of them. Also, They have the same price.

Exact question: why is that?

It sounds like the difference is a minor nuance that doesn't need its menu entry. Presenting one pizza and listing available toppings serves users better.

Now, imagine you are in a meeting, and the group is choosing the architecture to implement a new feature later. The group responsible for presenting options shows a few architectural approaches. Many of them are like the above pizza, all the same except for a few minor options. The generated cognitive load can only lead to undesirable questions.

There is a high chance the meeting gets derailed by fruitless questions connected to the nuances rather than focusing on the critical differences between the various options.

## Conclusion 

When designing APIs or defining and presenting design choices, it's essential to avoid creating confusion and fruitless questions for the audience. When it comes to APIs, ask yourself why there is a need for multiple paths to the same result. And when presenting choices, make sure that critical decisions factors stand out. If it's not a crucial decision factor, there are many cases where it might be noise. We might serve our users better by not presenting it at all.
