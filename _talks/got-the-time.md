title: "Got the time"
synopsis: ""Check if overdue invoices are paid." Seems simple enough. But when are invoices due? Are they all due on the same day?

"Apply discounts to customers whose balance is more than $500." Well, that sounds simple too. But are customers' balances and discounts stable? Or do they change over time?

When designing a system from "requirements", it's not always easy to spot the impact of the passage of time. It's too easy to fall into the trap of solving a business problem with a technical solution. We end up using batch jobs to try to catch up, resulting in a plate of spaghetti.

In this talk, we'll analyze what appears to be a straightforward billing system that needs to deal with invoices and discounts. How hard can it be? We'll then add a few more use-cases that make it more complicated and see how that can negatively impact the overall design.

Finally, we'll focus our attention on the impact of time on the design, and see how it sheds light on the correct approach to designing features.

(All we want, two, three, go! Time, got the time tick tick tickin' in my head!)"
